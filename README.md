# Automatic-weed-detection-and-classification
1. This is a project that has been done as my 6th semester's mini project.
2. In this project I have used VGG16 and SVM technique to classify and identify weeds from crops.
3. The dataset that I have used was obtained from Kaggle which contains sesame plants as crops and rest as weeds.
